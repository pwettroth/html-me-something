        <h3>Zion National Park</h3>

        <p>
            Driving through Zion leaves me breathless, as colorful sandstone cliffs enclose the road and stretch up 
            to impossible heights. There are a few hikes that reveal the beauty of the park, but to reach those spots
            one must be determined - the cliffs that you drove through before must now be climbed!

        <h3>Arches National Park</h3>

        <p>
            Arches has a very interesting geological timeline. A combination of rock and salt lined up just right, plus
            a million years of erosion has resulted in the stunning features that attract guests year after year. Natural
            rock arches are the most numerous (over 2,000!), but there are also pinnacles, fins, and balanced rocks.
