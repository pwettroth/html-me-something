        <h3>Yellowstone National Park</h3>
        <img class = "resize" src= ".\Images\IMG_2941.jpg"/>
        <p>The world's first national park was founded in 1872. Yellowstone National Park sparked my interest in geology, and 
            continues to leave me awestruck with each visit. A large portion of the park contains a caldera that is the result
            of three massive volcanic eruptions which occurred millions of years ago. The park sits atop a thin layer of Earth's 
            crust. Its proximity to partial molten magma is responsible for many interesting geothermal features, including 
            hot springs, geysers, mudpots, and fumaroles.

            In addition to geothermal features, Yellowstone also features mountains, valleys, lakes, forests, and waterfalls. One
            of my favorite places in the park is the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, pictured above. Carved by the Yellowstone
            River, this canyon doesn't compare to the Grand Canyon in size but the colors are astounding!

        <h3>Grand Teton National Park</h3>
        <img class = "resize" src = ".\Images\IMAG0050.jpg" />
        <p>
            Located just south of Yellowstone, Grand Teton National Park is named after the highest peak in the Teton Range, a 
            prominent and picturesque range within the Rocky Mountains. The park is an escape into serenity. There are many miles
            of hiking trails around lakes and through rugged mountain wilderness.
