        <p>Rocky Mountain National Park was estblished in 1915. The main road running through the park, Trail Ridge Road, is
            the highest continual highway in the country. Its maximum height is 12,183 feet above sea level. Over 300 miles of
            trails take you through pristine mountain wilderness, leading to countless lakes, waterfalls, and wildflower meadows.

        <p>The aspen leaves in the Rocky Mountains begin to change in mid-September, and peak in late September-early October.
            I was two weeks late for the peak but still had the chance to experience some intense color.</p>
